+ Since this is a WebApp with the MEAN implementations, I added at this time some AngularJS scripts, also the structure is slighly different; it has been modulated for better maintenance and understandable.<br>
+ Fixed a bug that happened at the time an user wanted to sign out (navbar top-right side).<br>
+ Added a better logo.<br>
+ Appereance has been modified.<br>
+ Added some files.<br>
- Deleted the prev index.html file and moved to another route, since I implemented the UI.router and Swig.
- Changes has been done at server.js file, due require to meets UI.router needs.<br>
